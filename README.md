<h2>HateTron: HATE SPEECH DETECTION CHATBOT</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This study introduces HateTron, a chatbot for detecting hate speech that achieves 90% accuracy
by using logistic regression. The study's background is the growing demand for efficient
automated systems to find/identify and report/address hate-speech on internet. The goal is to
create a chatbot that interacts with users and can quickly identify Hate Speech. Several models
have been trained on a tweets dataset that have been annotated as Hate Speech, Offensive
Language, and Safe Speech as part of the methodology used in this study, and the model with
the highest accuracy is chosen. After that, the classifier is included into a chatbot that can
communicate with people and identify hate speech and other inappropriate language in their
communications.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the chatbot, a sample of tweets with offensive, safe, and hate speech was
used. The evaluation's findings demonstrated that the chatbot could distinguish between safe
and objectionable speech with 90% accuracy. In conclusion, the chatbot created in this work
to detect hate speech is a potentially useful tool for preventing hate speech instances anywhere.</p>
